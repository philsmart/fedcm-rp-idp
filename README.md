# fedcm-rp-idp

Basic spring boot projects to test the [FedCM](https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/) APIs for both the Identity Provider and Relying Party.

| Project | Description | Runnable |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| fedcm-model | The API model interfaces and implementation | no |
| fedcm-idp | A mocked Identity Provider that provides the endpoints require for FedCM testing | yes |
| fedcm-rp | A mocked Relying Party for initiating the FedCM API to authentication with the fedcm-idp | yes |
| fedcm-multi | A project that runs both fedcm-rp and fedcm-idp inside the same Tomcat container for testing both components on the same host | yes |

Both The RP and IdP can be run standalone in their own embedded Tomcat container on port 8080. 


## Building the projects

To build the projects:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and Java17 installed
3. From the root directory run: `mvn clean package`
4. This will create three runnable projects, each can be started as follows:
    1. For the IdP, `java -jar fedcm-idp/target/fedcm-idp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    2. For the RP, `java -jar fedcm-rp/target/fedcm-rp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    3. For both together, `java -jar fedcm-multi/target/fedcm-multi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
5. All components start on the standard HTTP port (8080), hence without adjustment you can not run the IdP and RP as standalone services on the same host â€” that is what the multi project is for. 
	1. To sign in to the IdP, navigate to `http://idp.localhost:8080/idp` and click sign in. You do not need any credentials, it just creates a session for you on the IdP.
	2. For the RP, navigate to `https://rp.localhost:8080/rp` and try out the FedCM features. 
	
## Configuring the projects

If you want to override any of the default properties, you can supply appropriate VM options when running the JAR. The following options are useful:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
|server.port|8080 | the server port | 
|fedcm.rp.idpConfig| Internal config for `http://idp.localhost:8080/fedcm.json` | location of the CredentialRequestOptions the RP uses to configure IdPs | 
| fedcm.idp.idpAccounts| Internal accounts JSON file | location of the IdentityProviderAccounts the IdP uses as the account information for the user|

Options are supplied using the standard Java command line system property syntax, for example (you only need to provide the options you need):

```
java -Dfedcm.idp.rootdomain=idp.localhost:8080 -Dserver.port=8080 -Dfedcm.idp.hostname=idp.localhost:8080 -Dfedcm.rp.idpConfig=file:config.json -jar fedcm-multi/target/fedcm-multi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

```
